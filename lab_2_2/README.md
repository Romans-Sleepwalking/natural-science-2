## Investigation of the electric field.

### Summary

* **The shape of n equipotentials is curved and mostly vertical.** It is denser near the electrode. The conducive rings bend the equipotential lines.

* **There is not field inside both rings.** That proves that both rings are metal conductors and not plastic isolators. The electric field inside the rings is zero because the electrons accumulate inside the ring moving around; therefore, cancelling the field inside the ring.
