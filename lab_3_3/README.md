# Laboratory work 3.3

## Flat diffraction grating.

### Summary

* **This laboratory work studied the properties of a diffraction grating.** The grating constant depends on the wavelength and the angle.

* **The constant of the grating d = 8.96 Â± 0.19 micro meters.** To improve the accuracy, consider making more observations per order of spectrum to capture the random error at each angle measurement step to filter out mismeasured observations and get better statistical power for the average.
